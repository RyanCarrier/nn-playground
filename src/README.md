# Pt 1

Making 2 input and implementing AND
Then go to 3 and add or


prior knowledge makes the current plan;

3 inputs, 1 output

4? internal nodes with 2 layers?
 
 - I know we need more internal nodes than inputs, for combination inputs
 - we would also need multiple layers to then handle those combination inputs no? (like if you had first 2 bits are for and/or and second 2 are for inputs, you would need combination first 2 bits to know how to handle second 2 bits)
 - though with that it feels like layers is context dependant, and not actually node dependant...

Learning rate can scale linearly it will be fine
